Take a look at the interface List-adt1.h.  Can you:

1. Use the given abstract data type (ADT) to create a list in a main.cpp?
2. What can be improved?  What questions do you have?

Questions and Improvements
==========================

1. What is the meaning of "k" in remove() and get()?
2. But I can only create a list of integers. Can it be more generic?
3. How is the list being implemented? (YOU SHOULDN'T CARE)
4A. Is there a capacity for this list?
4B. If not, can I create a list with a maximum capacity?
5. What is the initial size of the list?
6. Are my assumptions on the meaning of the functions correct?

The Purposes of this Exercise
=============================
* Interface: what, not how
* Information hiding via interface and implementation
* Parameterization
* The need for contracts, good documentation, and coding style
* Build specific programs that uses high-level abstractions
